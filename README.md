# 5023Y-intro-to-linear-models

Lesson 1: Intro to stats:

In today's lesson we learned how to calculate mean and SD between two groups (crossed and self plant groups from a datat set of Darwin). Using this we then learnt how to estimate standard error and confidence intervals in order to describe how much confidence we have that our experiments would capture the true population mean.

Lesson 2: Intro linear models:

In today's lesson I learned how to use the lm function to compare means, calculate SED and CI, as well as checking assumptions of a linear model. We determined the answer to darwin's question and that the null can be rejected

Lesson 3: Testing:

In today's lesson, we learnt to calculate P-values and test statistical significance for our experiments using linear models. We also compared the linear model structures for producing a paired vs. unpaired t-test. We learnt about type 1 and 2 errors and how confidence intervals and effect sizes can be used to assess these, with a requirement of repeating experiments. We learnt that reliance on reporting P-values is uninformative and can be misleading. Instead reporting estimates and confidence intervals allows us to report our levels of uncertainty, and provides results which are more informative for comparitive studies.
