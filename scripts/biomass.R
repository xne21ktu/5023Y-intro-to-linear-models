# We can see an increase in biomass with the addition of light (30.12g) but with a standard error of 32.72g, further analysis of confidence intervals reveals that they go past 0 (-35.3 - 95.6) and so there is no real confidence that this increase of biomass is of true effect.
# In contrast the addition of fertiliser shows a mean increase of 93.7[28.2-159 95% CI] and the addition of both showing a mean increase of 219 [154-285 95% CI].

# can see that for the addition of light, the lower CI goes past 0.

# combine the average mean differences of the light effect and fertiliser effect
coef(ls_1)[2] + coef(ls_1)[3] 

# compare this to the average difference of the combined treatment
coef(ls_1)[4]

# we would expect that adding the mean difference caused by light and the mean difference caused by fertiliser would be close to the combined mean difference shown in column 4 (F+L+)
# as we can see 123.8 and 219.2 do not match
# This suggests there may be a positive interaction (that light and fertiliser treatments produce a sum effect that is greater than could be predicted by looking at their individual effects).
# The one-way ANOVA only tells us if there is a difference between the control group and the combined group but it does not tell us the strength of the interaction effect (combined F+ L+), i.e. is their a true interaction, how confident are we, and how does the strength of the intercation effect differ to the main effects (addition of F/L on their own)
# To test for interactions, we use a factorial design

#______________________----
# ANOVA Tables ----

# we previously ran the anova() function directly on our linear model, but this only works for simple and balanced designs (same number of sample sizes in each level of a factor).
# when working with unbalanced or complex designs (including those where you suspect an interaction effect) you need to use the drop1() function.
# This reports an F statistic for the interaction effect, carrying out an F-test of two models, one with and one without the interaction effect.
# It is a good idea to always use drop1 instead of anova to reduce the risk of human error.
drop1(ls_2, test = "F")

#This F-test is testing the null hypothesis that there is no true interaction effect. The significance test rejects the null hypothesis (just).

#There was an interactive effect of light and fertiliser treatments (ANOVA F1,60 = 4.25, P = 0.044) in which combining treatments produced substantially more biomass (95.4g [95% CI: 2.8 - 188]) than expected from the additive effects alone (Fertiliser 93.7g [28.2 - 159.2], Light 30.1g [-35.3 - 95.6]).

# main effects ----

# If there is interactions in the model, then the drop1 function stops, this is because if this interaction is significant, then the main effects need to be included, even if they are not significant on their own.
# If we decide to include reports of the main effect then estimates and confidence intervals should come from the full model(one-way ANOVA in this ex), but we need to produce an interaction free model to produce accurate F-values (especially for unbalanced designs)

# we have to remove the interaction term before we can keep using drop1()

ls_3 <- lm(biomass_m2 ~ fert + light, data = biomass)

drop1(ls_3, test = "F")

# provides more accurate F values for the main effects

#_____________________----
# Balanced/Unbalanced Designs ----

# When designs are not balanced then the order matters when we use anova() - this is because the sum of squares is calculated sequentially (in the order of the formula), and so we could get different results depending on the order in which we assemble predictors into our model.

# make three vectors and combine them into a new tibble
